Under construction:This app pretends to grab 
your outfit images form your camera (let you crop), your camera roll, your facebook (by facial recognition), instagram (the same) and pinterest (same here). Then import those images into your outfit collection. You can select your daily outfit based on the wheather forecast you have in the first screen in conjunction with the calendar events displayed there, too. You can grab images of any piece of fashion you like and add it to the wishlist, and each time you pass by a shop which has an ibeacon in that section, it will send you a push notification letting you know that in there shop there is the item/s you saved in your wishlist (or similar items).
